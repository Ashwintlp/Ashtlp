                Sports Goods are defined as tangible, physical products that offer benefits to consumers.
                Conversely, services are intangible, non-physical products. Most sports products possess the
                characteristics of both goods and services. Sports goods industry is comprised of all
                establishments primarily engaged in retailing new sporting goods, health and fitness equipments,
                apparels or hosiery, sports shoes various sports equipments and accessories which are sold by
                sports good retailers and whole sellers.

                It is axiomatic that consumers participate in the activities
                for which they buy various sports products; where as in some cases it may be in obverse
                condition people may not buy products for participation; e.g. Tread - mill or Jogger may not be
                used at Health clubs, Cricket Matting or Helmets may be shared by one or more teams. Table
                Tennis Table may be borrowed or rented etc. None less in many sports events participating
                trends are clearly correlated with consumer's products. One believes that sports product is a
                good, service or any combination such as (a) Product availability in the region, b) Geographic
                location of the region, c) Economic condition of the sports participants, etc. are the few points to
                be mentioned.
